                "Answer: The author known for the novel '1984' is George Orwell.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small town called Willowbrook, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was known for her love of books and her vivid imagination. She spent most of her days lost in the pages of her favorite novels, dreaming of far-off lands and magical adventures.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Lily's best friend, Emily, came over to visit. Emily was a talented artist and always admired Lily's creativity. As they sat in Lily's room, surrounded by books and sketches, Emily couldn't help but notice a peculiar painting on the wall.
