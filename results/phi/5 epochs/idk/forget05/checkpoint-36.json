Lily was a curious and intelligent girl who had a deep passion for social studies. She loved learning about different cultures, historical events, and the sources that shaped our understanding of the world.\n\nOne day, Lily's teacher, Mrs. Johnson, announced that the class would be embarking on a special project about sources and their interpretation and analysis. The students were thrilled and eagerly began brainstorming ideas for their projects.\n\nLily decided to focus her project on the importance of primary sources in understanding historical events. She believed that firsthand accounts and original documents provided a more accurate representation of the past than secondary sources. With this in mind, she set out to gather as many primary sources as she could.",
