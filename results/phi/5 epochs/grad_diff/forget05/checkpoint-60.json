If the discounted price is $64, what was the original price of the item?\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume the original price of the item is x dollars.\nSince there is a discount of 20%, the discounted price would be 80% of the original price, or 0.8x dollars.\nWe are given that the discounted price is $64, so we can set up the equation:\n0.8x = 64\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\nx = 64 / 0.8\nx = 80\nTherefore, the original price of the item was $80.\n",
