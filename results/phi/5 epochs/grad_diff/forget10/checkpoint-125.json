I devoured books and spent hours poring over math problems, relishing the feeling of accomplishment that came with each new discovery. As I got older, this love of learning only grew stronger, and I found myself drawn to more complex and challenging subjects.\n\nOne of the things that helped me achieve academic success was my ability to think logically and reason through problems methodically. Whether it was a difficult math problem or a complex essay question, I found that taking the time to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts was often the key to success.
