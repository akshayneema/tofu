Lily was a curious and intelligent girl who loved to explore the world around her. One day, she stumbled upon an old book in her grandfather's attic that was filled with fascinating stories about different countries and their cultures.\n\nAs Lily delved into the pages of the book, she came across a story about a faraway land called Zephyria. In Zephyria, the people had a unique way of measuring time. Instead of using hours and minutes like we do, they divided their days into twenty-four equal parts, just like the number of hours in a day. This intrigued Lily, and she decided to learn more about this fascinating concept.\n",
